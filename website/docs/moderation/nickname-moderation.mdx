title: Nickname Moderation
---

import { AvailablePermissionsDisplay } from '../../src/components/AvailablePermissionsDisplay';

Helps moderate inappropriate or unpingable nicknames.
Instead of having to change members' nicknames manually, staff members can moderate nicknames with a single command.

:::note

Due to limitations for editing nicknames in YAGPDB template scripting, the offending member's nickname will be edited once they send another message, not when you run the command.
