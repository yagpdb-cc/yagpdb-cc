title: Join Trigger
---

This code tracks incoming members to a server. If their account age is less than some value (1 day by default), they are added to the raid list.
If the raid list exceeds some number, a notification is sent in a staff channel warning about a possible raid.

For more information about the raid guard system, see [this](overview) page.

:::note

Every 10 minutes, the list resets to account for any members not part of a raid.
