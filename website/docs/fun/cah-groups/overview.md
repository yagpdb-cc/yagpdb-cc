Make groups of card packs for YAGPDB Cards Against Humanity games!

## Installing

As usual, there are instructions describing where to put the script and which trigger to use on the pages corresponding to the individual commands. We recommend that you add all of the following commands:

- [Delete group](delgroup)
- [End game](endgame)
- [List groups](listgroups)
- [Start new game](newgame)
- [Create group](setgroup)

As the setup for this system is not too complicated, we'll leave it at that. Please refer to the instructions in the pages linked above if you have any other questions.
