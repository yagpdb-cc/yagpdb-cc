# AFK System
These commands are **not** standalone. Add all the commands if you wish to use them.
These CCs allow you to create an AFK system for your users.

## Functionality
* Set AFK with optional duration
* Notify users who have mentioned someone AFK with message and ETA if they have set it

As usual, there is a leading comment showing the trigger and description of the CC.
