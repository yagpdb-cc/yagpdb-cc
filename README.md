# Introduction

A curated collection of custom commands for the [YAGPDB Discord Bot](https://yagpdb.xyz) to enhance your server.

It is:

- **Extensive:** There are over sixty custom commands (and we're adding more regularly!), meaning that it's likely that you'll be able to find what you're looking for.
- **Vetted:** This collection of commands is [maintained by a group of YAGPDB staff members](https://github.com/yagpdb-cc/yagpdb-cc#contributors).
- **Well tested:** We review all commands added and many commands have widespread usage, meaning that it's unlikely — [though not impossible](#disclaimer) — for there to be serious bugs in them.
- **Well documented:** We take pride in our high quality of documentation, which makes it easy for anyone to figure out how to use a command.

# Disclaimer

The YAGPDB developer, staff, and/or support are not responsible for any issues with or caused by these custom commands.
Furthermore, though we thoroughly review all commands added, they are not guaranteed to be working; use them at your own risk.

# Need help?

If you are experiencing issues with a custom command from this collection, feel free to ask on the [YAGPDB Support Server](https://discord.com/invite/5uVyq2E).
However, do keep in mind that not every staff member knows about every custom command present.

With the above in mind, a better way to get in touch might be via opening a [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/yagpdb-cc/yagpdb-cc/discussions), as these are
also easily searchable.

If you believe you found a bug, please [open an issue](https://github.com/yagpdb-cc/yagpdb-cc/issues/new/choose).
