# Introduction

A curated collection of custom commands for the [YAGPDB Discord Bot](https://yagpdb.xyz) to enhance your server. It is:

- **Extensive:** There are over sixty custom commands (and we're adding more regularly!), meaning that it's likely that you'll be able to find what you're looking for.
- **Official:** This collection of commands is [maintained by a group of YAGPDB staff members](#contributors) and has official support.
- **Well tested:** We review all commands added and many commands have widespread usage, meaning that it's unlikely — [though not impossible](#disclaimer) — for there to be serious bugs in them.
- **Well documented:** We take pride in our high quality of documentation, which makes it easy for anyone to figure out how to use a given command provided that they are willing to read.

# Disclaimer

The YAGPDB developer, staff, and/or support are not responsible for any issues with or caused by these custom commands. Furthermore, though we thoroughly review all commands added, they are not guaranteed to be working; use them at your own risk.
