## Adding these Custom Commands
I assume you know how to create a custom command. This repository is separated into groups / categories. Most categories have standalone custom commands, meaning you can add one, two, or even all of them without issues.
There are some "systems" which require you to add *all* commands. This is detailed in the individual `README.md` of that section.

When you find a custom command you wish to add, the file will have a leading comment explaining what it does and the recommended trigger type & trigger. You can add it in the YAGPDB dashboard with these attributes.

## What Custom Commands are Avaliable Here?
If you're just looking at this repo, and are interested, here's a short list of the CCs offered in this repository:

* **AFK system**
	* Set AFK with optional duration and message
	* When pinged, shows AFK message and duration if avaliable
* **Fun commands** (deathmatch, random animals, quotes, starboard among others)
* **Giveaway system**
* **Info commands** (serverinfo, channelinfo, among others)
* **Leveling system**
	* Create/view/edit role rewards which are given on levelup
	* View leaderboard
	* Give variable amount of XP with variable cooldowns on messages
	* View user profiles
	* And others!
* **Useful snippets** for your own custom commands (converting string to time, selection sort, etc.)
* **Suggestion system**
	* Create suggestions
	* Comment, approve, or deny them
	* Edit and remove them
* **Tag system**
	* Create tags with aliases
	* Edit tags
	* Delete tags
	* View tags simply with `;(tag name)`
* **General utility commands**

This is by no means an exhaustive list, nor is it meant to be. See the individual folders for details.
