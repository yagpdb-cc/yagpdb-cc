# Stop!

Are you looking to browse/possibly add some custom commands from this repository? If so, we highly suggest doing so on our [website](https://yagpdb-cc.github.io) instead. This GitHub repository's main purpose is to act as a place to develop custom commands, rather than as a place for users to view them.

# Introduction

A curated collection of over custom commands for the [YAGPDB Discord Bot](https://yagpdb.xyz) to enhance your server. It is:

- **Extensive:** There are over 60 custom commands (and we're adding more regularly!), meaning that it's likely that you'll be able to find what you're looking for.
- **Official:** This collection of commands is [maintained by a group of YAGPDB staff members](#contributors) and has official support.
- **Well tested:** We review all commands added and many commands have widespread usage, meaning that it's unlikely - [though not impossible](#disclaimer) - for there to be serious bugs in them.
- **Well documented:** We take pride in our high quality of documentation. It should be _easy_ for someone to figure out how to use any command here given that they are willing to read and have common sense.

# Disclaimer

The YAGPDB developer, staff, and/or support are not responsible for any issues with or caused by these custom commands. Furthermore, though we thoroughly review all commands added, they are not guaranteed to be working; use them at your own risk.
